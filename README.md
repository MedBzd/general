# General
Templates and configurations for various projects and deployment scenarios

General for Automation and Deployment
These are my templates and configurations I use in various projects and deployment scenarios. They are based on automation and deployment tools such as Ansible, Docker, Terraform, and much more.

I created them as free resources to be extended according to your specific use cases. If you're searching for detailed.

Warning
Please beware that products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this wonâ€™t always be the case.
